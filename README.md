# Motivation
I wanted to explore using the LSTM RNN, one of the application it has is to generate text.  
I chose to generate lyrics as if they were from a Lana Del Rey song, because is the only artist I listen to who produces music with lyrics, so I'm very familiar with her lyrical style and would be able to tell if something is written in this style. 

# Data Source
I pulled latest 5 Lana Del Rey studio albums from Genius.com using the package lyricsgenius.  
There are 83 songs in total, the albums are: 
- Born to Die: The Paradise Edition
- Ultraviolence
- Honeymoon
- Lust for Life
- Norman F***ing Rockwell!
